    <h1>Bibimbap recipe</h1>
    <p class="introduction">
        Korean bibimbap, along with kimchi, takes its place among the favored foods in Korean cuisine.
        Meaning mixed
        rice, bibimbap is a popular meal consisting of white rice topped with vegetables, beef, a whole egg, and
        gochujang (red chili pepper paste). You can substitute with soy sauce or Sriracha (rooster sauce) for those
        who
        cannot handle the spiciness, like our children.

    <p class="normalTruc">Stir together cucumber and gochujang paste in a bowl; set aside</p>
    <h3 class="anotherThing">Step 2</h3>
    <p class="normalTruc">Bring about 2 cups water to a boil in a large nonstick skillet and stir in spinach; cook until
        bright green and

    <h3 class="anotherThing">Step 3</h3>
    <p class="normalTruc">Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet; cook and stir carrots until softened,

        flakes. Set mixture aside in a bowl.

    <h3 class="anotherThing">Step 6</h3>

        and cucumber
        mixture. Place 1 egg atop each serving. Drizzle each bowl with 1 teaspoon sesame oil, a sprinkle of sesame
        seeds, and a small amount of gochujang paste if desired.</p>
